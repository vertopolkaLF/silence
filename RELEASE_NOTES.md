# 🎤 silence! v1.0 — Initial Release

> **Your meetings just got less awkward.**

We're thrilled to announce the first official release of **silence!** — a lightweight, no-bullshit microphone mute utility for Windows.

---

## ✨ What's New (Everything, it's v1.0!)

### 🎯 Core Features

- **Global Hotkey Muting** — Mute/unmute your microphone from absolutely anywhere. Gaming? Browsing? In Excel pretending to work? Doesn't matter, hotkey works everywhere.

- **System Tray Integration** — Lives quietly in your system tray. Green icon = you're live. Red icon = you're safe. No rocket science required.

- **One-Click Toggle** — Click the tray icon to toggle mute. Double-click opens settings. Your grandma could use this.

### ⌨️ Hotkey System

- **Full Modifier Support** — Create complex hotkeys like `Ctrl + Alt + M` or keep it simple with `F13`, `Pause`, whatever floats your boat.

- **Flexible Modifier Matching** — Enable "Ignore extra modifiers" so your `Shift + F23` hotkey also fires when you accidentally hit `Ctrl + Shift + F23`. We got you.

### 🎨 Modern UI

- **Mica/Acrylic Backdrop** — Windows 11 gets Mica, Windows 10 gets Acrylic. Everyone wins.

- **Smooth Animations** — Buttery smooth state transitions because we're not animals.

- **Adaptive Theme** — Follows your system theme. Dark mode gang rise up.

### ⚙️ Convenience

- **Microphone Selection** — Pick which mic to control. Useful if you have 47 audio devices like a normal person.

- **Auto-Start with Windows** — Enable it once, forget about it forever.

- **Start Minimized** — Boot straight to system tray. No window popping up in your face.

- **Portable** — No MSIX installer bullshit. Extract → Run → Profit.
